# Predictive-Modeling-for-Student-Final-Scores-based-on-Initial-Assessments
Create a predictive model to estimate students' final scores from initial assessments, given a consistent order and grading scheme. Use previous course data for training and current data for testing. The dataset includes morning (training) and afternoon (testing) sessions. Predict scores from the 5th activity onward.
