# Predictive-Modeling-for-Student-Final-Scores-based-on-Initial-Assessments

## Project Overview

This project focuses on applying MLOps practices to streamline and automate the lifecycle of machine learning models. The primary goal is to ensure seamless integration, continuous delivery, and deployment of models in a scalable and reliable manner. The project covers various stages including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.

## Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Implementing data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
   - Ensuring the data is prepared for efficient model training.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Training multiple machine learning models.
   - Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics and selecting the best model.

3. **Model Deployment**:
   - Containerizing the selected model using Docker.
   - Deploying the containerized model on a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Implementing autoscaling and monitoring to ensure high availability and performance.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing and deployment of the machine learning model.
   - Using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or similar for continuous integration and deployment.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains datasets used for training and testing the models.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **Models**: Serialized models saved after training.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and deployment.
- **Docker**: Dockerfiles and related configurations for containerizing the application.
